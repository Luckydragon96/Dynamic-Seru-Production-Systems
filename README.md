**Folder Description:**

In "Different dynamic events results" folder, "Metrics_w_m" represents the results of PDNSGA-II compared to DNSGA-II-A, DNSGA-II-B, SGEA at instance with _w_ workers and _m_ batches; "MHV_Result"/"MIGD_Result" represents the summary result of all "Metrics_w_m" after statistical tests on metrics MHV/MIGD;"Completely Reactive Result_w_m" represents the results of six on-line dynamic methods at instance with _w_ workers and _m_ batches and "Completely Reactive Summary Result" is their summary result.

In "Each dynamic event results" folder, four sub-folders (i.e.,"Worker tool breakdowns and repairs","New batch arrivals","Batch cancellations" and "Batch size changes") represent experimental results under each dynamic event. Thus, each sub-folder contains files similar to those of "Different dynamic events results" folder.

In "PDNSGA-II strategy analysis" folder, "PDNSGA2_Metrics_w_m" represents the results of PDNSGA-II compared to PDNSGA-II-noPRS, PDNSGA-II-noCM, PDNSGA-II-noPM, and PDNSGA-II-noMPS(PDNSGA-II-noHH) at instance with _w_ workers and _m_ batches;"PDNSGA2_MHV_Result"/"PDNSGA2_MIGD_Result" represents the summary result of all "Metrics_w_m" after statistical tests on metrics MHV/MIGD.

In "Epslion method results" folder, results obtained by epslion-constraint method are contained in the folder.
